<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Developer in the making, currently focused on mastering the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. My journey into web development started with a deep desire to create real-world solutions and bring ideas to life through clean, functional, and user-friendly applications. I believe that technology, when used mindfully, can be a tool for empowerment and impact.</p>

<p>Every day, I commit time to learning and practicing both frontend and backend skills. From designing responsive interfaces with React to building robust APIs with Express and Node.js, I enjoy understanding how every layer of a web application works together. I am also growing my Git and deployment skills to become confident in building and launching full-fledged projects. The process of debugging, improving, and seeing things come alive on screen is something that truly excites me.</p>

<p>I see this journey not just as a career path, but as a way to build confidence, discipline, and independence. With each line of code, I’m not only solving problems but also becoming a stronger version of myself. I’m eager to contribute to real-world projects, collaborate with like-minded developers, and continue learning every single day. My goal is to become a skilled, mindful developer who creates meaningful digital experiences.</p>
